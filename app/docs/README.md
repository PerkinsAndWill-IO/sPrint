# Clarity Parity Documentation

> "The software worked well, we took a tedious task off our employees' plates, and we spent a lot of time getting to know IMAGINIT," said Matt Petermann. "It was a very successful pilot."

## Overview

This documentation covers the comparison between **Clarity** and **sPrint** systems, focusing on PDF generation and printing capabilities within architectural and engineering contexts (Revit, ACC/B360).

## Documentation Structure

- **[Clarity Parity Overview](./clarity-parity.md)** - Main comparison document with parity table
- **[PDF Export (Sheets → PDFs)](./pdf-export.md)** - Section 1: Sheet-driven PDF generation
- **[Bundled / Collated PDFs](./bundled-collated-pdfs.md)** - Section 2: PDF bundling capabilities
- **[Scheduled / Automated Printing](./scheduled-automated-printing.md)** - Section 3: Automation and scheduling
- **[Print Configuration & Fidelity](./print-config-fidelity.md)** - Section 4: Print settings and output quality
- **[Guaranteed Output Across Project Types](./guaranteed-output.md)** - Section 5: Edge cases and reliability
- **[Needed Features](./needed-features.md)** - Feature requests and improvements

## Quick Reference

Clarity provides five distinct things (for drawings):

1. Sheet-driven PDF generation
2. Bundled / collated PDFs
3. Scheduled / repeatable execution
4. Print configuration control
5. Guaranteed fidelity (what Revit sees is what prints)
